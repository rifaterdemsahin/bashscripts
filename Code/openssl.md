# Creating Certificates for Thanos and Components using OpenSSL

This guide will help you generate certificates for Thanos and its components using OpenSSL. These certificates will ensure secure communication between the Thanos components.

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSL installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

## Steps

### 1. Generate a Certificate Authority (CA)

First, create a private key and a self-signed certificate for the CA.

```bash
# Generate CA private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Generate CA certificate
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=thanos-ca"
```

### 2. Generate Certificates for Thanos Components

For each Thanos component (e.g., Querier, Store Gateway, Sidecar), follow these steps:

#### Example: Generate Certificate for Thanos Querier

1. **Generate a private key for the Querier**

    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out querier.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
    ```

2. **Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -key querier.key -out querier.csr -subj "/CN=thanos-querier"
    ```

3. **Sign the CSR with the CA to get the certificate**

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -in querier.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out querier.crt -days 365 -sha256
    ```

Repeat these steps for other components like Store Gateway, Sidecar, Receiver, etc., replacing `querier` with the appropriate component name.

### 3. Verify the Certificates

You can verify the generated certificates using the following commands:

```bash
# Verify CA certificate
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout

# Verify Querier certificate
openssl x509 -in querier.crt -text -noout
```

### 4. Configure Thanos Components to Use the Certificates

Update your Thanos Helm values or configuration files to include the paths to the generated certificates.

#### Example: Thanos Querier Configuration

```yaml
querier:
  extraArgs:
    - --grpc-client-tls-secure
    - --grpc-client-tls-cert=/certs/querier.crt
    - --grpc-client-tls-key=/certs/querier.key
    - --grpc-client-tls-ca=/certs/ca.crt
  extraVolumes:
    - name: certs
      secret:
        secretName: thanos-certs
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: certs
      mountPath: /certs
```

### 5. Deploy Thanos with the Certificates

Deploy or update your Thanos setup with the new certificate configurations.

```bash
helm upgrade --install thanos bitnami/thanos -f values.yaml
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have generated and configured certificates for secure communication between Thanos components. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out!
